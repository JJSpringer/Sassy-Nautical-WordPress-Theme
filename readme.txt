Thank you for downloading my theme! Below are common things that you might like to change about the theme and where those solutions are located. If I get enough interest in the theme, I will add further color palettes and custom header functions. Please enjoy!

// Sidebar //
This theme is full-width and therefore does not have a sidebar. If you would like to add widgets, there is an optional space if you would like to use widgets in the footer. Just add them in the widgets area. They appear in the order that they appear in the widgets area and go across the footer in groups of threes.

// Featured Images //
The dimensions for the featured images are 984px x 250px. To have the thumbnails work properly, the original image needs to be larger than 984px wide so it crops it properly. If you have switched to this theme from another theme that had smaller featured images, please install and run the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin so your images will be cropped properly. http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress-plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/ If you have an image that is too small, it will stretch to the full width while not cropping properly and the image will pixelate. I would recommend only using images that are large enough or just not having a featured image for that post.

// Changing Colors //
If you would like to change the colors overall, just change the hex colors at the top of the _global file and they will change throughout the site. If you don't know how to use Sass, I would recommend creating a child theme and changing the colors through that.

// Fonts //
If you would like to change the fonts, they are located in the _global file as functions. Just change them there and compile the files. If you don't know how to use Sass, I would recommend creating a child theme and changing the colors through that.

// Sass and Compass //
This theme was created with Compass and Sass. If you would like to use these files, they are located in the sass folder. I recommend CodeKit if you are interested in compiling Sass and if you are interested in learning Sass, I recommend taking the Sass classes offered by Code School. http://www.codeschool.com/courses/assembling-sass 

// Buttons //
The buttons were created with Sassy Buttons. If you would like to edit the buttons, please check out the guide on the creator's site. http://jaredhardy.com/sassy-buttons/

// Sprites //
The sprite map is created using sass. If you would like to change out the sprites, you will need to change it using the sass files. Just replace the image with an image of the same filename in the folder and then compile your sass files and it should automatically regenerate the sprite map for you.

// Meta //
If you would like to remove any of the meta, it's located in the template tags file in the sassy_nautical_post_meta_footer function.

// Favicon //
The favicon was made with Faviconer.com. I recommend using them to export a .ico file if you would like to make your own.

//Infinite Scroll //
This theme has been set up to use Jetpack for infinite scroll. To turn on infinite scroll for your site, download the Jetpack plugin: http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/  When you download Jetpack, click "Activate" and then select "Settings". This will bring you to the Jetpack screen. Find the Infinite Scroll box and click the "Activate" button and you should be good to go! 

// Anchor Image //
To change the anchor image at the top of the theme, resize the image that you would like to use to fit in a 150px x 150px square .png file. Name your file "img_anchor.png" and replace the file located in the images folder of this theme.
